Restaurant Management Application - BRD

1. Purpose
This Business Requirement Document (BRD) defines the requirements for a console-based
Restaurant Management Application. The objective is to help the developer practice Java
Collections by using different collection types as in-memory databases. The application will
support CRUD operations, switch-case based dynamic menus, and exception handling for
invalid operations.

2. Scope
The application will allow management of menu items, customers, and orders. All data will
be stored using appropriate Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, LinkedList, etc.).
The application will run through console-based menus and support Create, Read, Update,
and Delete operations.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Menu Item Management
- Add a new menu item (ID, name, price, category).
- View all menu items.
- Update a menu item.
- Delete a menu item.
Collection Suggested: ArrayList or LinkedList.

3.2 Customer Management
- Add new customer (ID, name, phone number).
- View all customers.
- Update customer details.
- Delete a customer.
Collection Suggested: HashMap (ID as key).

3.3 Order Management
- Create new order (order ID, customer ID, list of menu items).
- View existing orders.
- Update an order by adding/removing menu items.

- Cancel an order.
Collections Suggested: HashMap for orders, LinkedList for order items.

4. Dynamic Console Flow
The application will use nested switch-case structures:
• Main Menu (Menu Management, Customer Management, Order Management, Exit)
• Each section will have CRUD options based on switch-case.

5. Exception Handling Requirements
Exception handling will be required in the following cases:
• Invalid menu selection → use custom MenuSelectionException.
• Duplicate ID while adding → use custom DuplicateEntryException.
• Missing ID while updating/deleting → use custom ResourceNotFoundException.
• Input mismatch (e.g., price entered as text) → handle InputMismatchException.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: CRUD operations must be fast using correct data structures.
- Usability: Simple console text-based navigation.
- Maintainability: Use modular classes (MenuService, CustomerService, OrderService).

7. Collections to Use
Menu Items → ArrayList
Customers → HashMap
Orders → HashMap
Unique Categories → HashSet
Order Items → LinkedList

8. Future Enhancements
- Add file-based storage.
- Add sorting using Comparator.
- Add Streams API for filtering items.
